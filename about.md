I have recently graduated from Université de Montréal where I studied computer science with strong emphasis on operations research. I have previously graduated from École des sciences de la gestion (ESG UQAM) where I studied finance.

This blog was first used to document the progress of my research project ([IFT3150](http://brilhana.github.io/IFT3150/)) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Fabian Bastin in 2017-2018.
